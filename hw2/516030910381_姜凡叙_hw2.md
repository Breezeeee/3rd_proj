## Git workflow

#### What

A Git Workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. Git offers a lot of flexibility in how we manage changes. Given Git's focus on flexibility, there is no standardized process on how to interact with Git.

There are many successful Git workflows.That includes:

- Centralized Workflow


- Feature Branch Workflow


- Forking Workflow
- ...

Git workflows encourage us to leverage Git effectively and consistently. When we use it, we can mix and match aspects from different workflows to suit our individual needs.

#### Why

##### Collaboration

In terms of Git process, collaboration is often very important. And collaboration is often about branching workflows. 

##### Release Management

The steps between going from collaboration to release are going to start at different points within the development process for each team. We all want to have the simplest possible workflow that will enable our team to deliver effectively.

#### How

The main progress of Git workflow may be this:

1. Navigate to our code repository
2. Fork the repository
3. Code our solution in the fork
4. Merge our solution with the test environment
5. Run tests on the code
6. Make any necessary corrections
7. Merge the test environment
8. GOOD!

And when we want to choose a kind of Git workflow for our team, we should take the culture of the team and many other things into consideration to make it most suitable for our team.
